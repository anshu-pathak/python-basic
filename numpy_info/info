Numpy
    -> NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. 
    Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed. This tutorial explains the basics of NumPy such as its architecture and environment. 
    It also discusses the various array functions, types of indexing, etc. An introduction to Matplotlib is also provided. All this is explained with the help of examples for better understanding.

History->
    Numeric, the ancestor of NumPy, was developed by Jim Hugunin. Another package Numarray was also developed, having some additional functionalities. In 2005, 
    Travis Oliphant created NumPy package by incorporating the features of Numarray into Numeric package. There are many contributors to this open source project.

Importance ->
    The most important object defined in NumPy is an N-dimensional array type called ndarray. It describes the collection of items of the same type. 
    Items in the collection can be accessed using a zero-based index.

Why is NumPy Faster Than Lists?
    NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.
    This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science.
    This is the main reason why NumPy is faster than lists. Also it is optimized to work with latest CPU architectures...

Which Language is NumPy written in?
    NumPy is a Python library and is written partially in Python, but most of the parts that require fast computation are written in C or C++.
